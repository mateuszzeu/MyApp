Fitally

Fitally is a fitness app that I am currently developing in my free time with SwiftUI, inspired by the personal need for a streamlined workout planner for myself and my close friends.
The app helps users create, manage, and track workout routines while seamlessly storing data in the cloud using Firebase.

Features
- Workout Management: 
  - Create custom workout days and exercises.
  - Edit, delete, and reorder exercises.
  - Save all progress to the cloud for easy access across devices.
- User Authentication: 
  - Register, log in, and reset your password using Firebase Authentication.
  - Secure account updates and data synchronization.
- Progress Tracking:
  - Interactive visualizations for monitoring progress.
  - Responsive, user-friendly design built entirely with SwiftUI.
- Water Intake Tracking:
  - Keep track of your daily hydration goals with an intuitive and visually engaging interface.
